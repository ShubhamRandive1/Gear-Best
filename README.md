As This Was The First Individual project I was thrilled and enthusiastic, Gearbest.com website was given to me  To Clone Using HTML, Advance JavaScript(ES6+) , and CSS As Of This Website Features an e-commerce site for all sense of products, So even from the start it was a bit of challenging,

But Apprently I had to take upon Challenge so I was ready to start working on the website, but as we know we need to have a plan of action I kickstarted with the home page,
